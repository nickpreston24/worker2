# Todoist Rescheduler (Daemon)

## Features I want to see

1. Reschedule every day.
   1. Goals:
      - [ ] Schedule 5 assorted tasks per day
      - [ ] FullDay strategy - 1 p1 or p2, 2x p3, 2x p4
      - [x] Ignore recurring tasks (needs fixing)
      - [ ] Create special project for "TickOffs" (things you want to check off, but forget to check, like p4 tasks, especially internet based tasks w/ urls!)
        - [ ] Maybe sniff urls in descriptions?
      - [ ] Exclude certain labels or projects from rescheduling (@nodate)
      - [ ] Re-enable bumping.   Run right after main rescheduling.
      - [ ] Prioritize things like meals, banking, job hunt stuff, etc.
      - [ ] Low-prioritize things like coding, hobbies, fun, etc.
   2. Features:
      1. Fun manager - schedule my relax time.  #mandatoryfun project
         1. Prioritize constructive things like bike rides and 3d prints 
         2. low prioritize things like youtube and tv shows, BUT DON'T ELIMINATE for now.  Give them some weight.
      2. Local Cache - Work off a local `.json` 
      3. Create a run history
         1. Store the time of run, payload and scheduling options.
